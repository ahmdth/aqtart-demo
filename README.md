# Aqtart Demo

Aqtart Demo is a Next.js project initialized with `create-next-app`.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** – React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **React** – Frontend JavaScript library for building UI components.
- **TypeScript** – Strongly typed JavaScript for better code quality and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for backend API handling.
- **Vercel** – Deployment platform for frontend applications.

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment:

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

2. **Run the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

   Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## Project Structure

- **`components/`**: Contains reusable React components used throughout the application.
- **`lib/`**: Holds utility functions and libraries for data fetching and other operations.
- **`pages/`**: Includes all the pages of the application, following Next.js's file-based routing system.
- **`public/`**: Stores static assets like images, fonts, and other files.
- **`styles/`**: Contains global and component-specific CSS styles.

## API Routes

API routes are located in the `pages/api` directory. For example:

- **`pages/api/hello.ts`**: Accessible at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello).

Files in this directory are treated as API endpoints instead of React components.
